      <div class="col-lg-12"> 
        <p>Inflation in the United States has skyrocketed over the course of the pandemic. Families are struggling to feed their kids, pay for their utilities bill, or do basic things like drive to doctor’s appointments. </p>

        <p>The pandemic has had an irreversible effect on the economy. A major teller of this is in the stark increase in gas prices. From March 2021 to March 2022, gas prices went up almost 50%. Fuel oil went up 70.1%. Although gas is what people notice, many other basic and everyday expenses have increased as well. They are increasing with no end in sight. Chief FInancial Officer of Paul Tudor Jones II Family Office Mikeal Andren said the problem started with the increase in cost of gas. Prices go up which affects how much people travel, how much plastics cost, and more. Transportation services start to cost more because they pay more in gas and energy in order to be able to run. Everything is connected in the world of supply and demand.  During the height of the pandemic when the majority of Americans were in quarantine, gas prices went down. The demand was low and the supply was high. Today, it is the opposite. </p>

        <iframe title="Consumer Prices Have Significantly Increased Over the Past Year With Gas and Oil Prices Having the Largest Change" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-krdMQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/krdMQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="479"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
        </div>

        <p>Another notable increase has been in used cars and trucks. Prices have increased over 35%. People don’t want to buy new cars anymore. Used vehicles have always been cheaper, but with so much demand and increasingly less supply, prices skyrocket. Even medical care commodities are increasing in price. Something that has always been scrutinized as being too expensive in the US is only becoming more of an issue and is not slowing down. Americans are feeling this change. Andren said he has noticed how going out to dinner with his family is starting to cost more than it was before inflation increased.</p>

        <p>Before the pandemic started in the US in February of 2020, the <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2022/what-is-inflation/> economy</a> was thriving. The stock market was high and unemployment was low. Then, the country shut down. The pandemic had an immediate effect on all of our lives in more ways than we could have imagined. Millions lost their jobs, small and large businesses alike were forced to shut down. And while all of this was happening, the government had no choice but to offer aid to the people. The White House and Congress offered trillions of dollars in aid. Businesses were able to open up and people got back on their feet again. </p>

        <p>And then came the Spring of 2021. The world was finally going back to normal again. So normal that the American people started spending at a rapid rate. People wanted new furniture, clothes, and houses. Industries couldn’t supply all of these things, so prices went up. And up, and more up. And people are still spending, even with increased prices. Now, inflation is at its worst since 1981. In fact, <a href=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2022/05/04/recession-2022-deutsche-bank/9587562002/?gnt-cfr=1/>Deutsche Bank</a> predicts that there will be a major recession in 2023 or 2024. </p>

        </div>

        <p>That being said, the Federal Reserve is committed to fixing this problem. They are raising interest rates slightly in the hopes that it will help. Andren has faith that this will be a solution. He called it a “very complex equation” but one that he believes is not impossible. After working in the finance world for most of his life, he knows that the world is run by money. Everyone and everything is controlled by it. The Federal Reserve is the only hope in fixing the problem. The solution lies in interest rates. The first step is convincing people to put more money in the bank. If they have more money in the bank, they spend less during their everyday life. According to Andren, they should then raise the interest rates from 1% to about 3%. This would help in balancing the costs of everyday items. It would help ease inflation. The federal reserve has already started raising interest rates, and they will continue to do so. </p>

        <p> Raising interest rates means that people will have to pay more money, but this will pay off in the long run. If this combats inflation, then everyday items such as food at the grocery and at restaurants will cost less. Parents will have less of an “are you kidding me” reaction when viewing the price tags when buying toys for their kids. </p>

        <p>But with current world issues and coronavirus still out there, it is a very difficult problem to solve. It is not as simple as just pressing a few buttons and solving it. The issue of gas prices going up is slightly involved with the Russian conflict in Ukraine. The United States only imports <a href=https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2022/03/09/how-much-does-the-us-rely-on-russia-for-energy-imports/> eight percent of its energy</a> from Russia and three percent of crude oil. President Biden cut off all of these imports, so we now have none of their energy, but the issue with inflation is having more of an effect on gas prices than the conflict in Russia is. </p>
